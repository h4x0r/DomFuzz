domfuzz \- generate domain name variations using typosquatting techniques
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B domfuzz
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIDOMAIN\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B domfuzz
is a comprehensive domain name variation generator that uses advanced typosquatting techniques to create potential malicious domain variations. It implements 22 different transformation algorithms organized into logical categories to simulate how attackers might create lookalike domains for phishing, brand impersonation, and other malicious activities.

The tool operates in two modes: one-transformation mode (default) where each algorithm is applied individually, and combo mode where transformations are chained together to create complex variations. Results can include similarity scoring, domain availability checking, and filtering by registration status.

.SH TRANSFORMATION ALGORITHMS
.B domfuzz
implements 22 different transformation algorithms organized into logical categories:

.SS Character-Level Transformations
Advanced character-level modifications that create visually similar domains. These transformations can be used individually with \fB-t transformation_name\fR or as part of the lookalike bundle (default):

.TP
.B 1337speak
Leetspeak (also known as "leet" or "1337") is a form of internet slang that replaces letters with visually similar numbers and symbols. This transformation simulates how attackers create typosquatting domains using character substitutions that are immediately recognizable to users but visually deceptive. The algorithm applies common internet culture replacements either individually or in realistic combinations.
.br
.br
\fBCharacter mappings:\fR
.br
• \fBo → 0\fR: The most common substitution, as zero and letter 'o' are nearly identical
.br
• \fBl → 1\fR: Lowercase 'l' and number '1' often appear identical in many fonts
.br
• \fBe → 3\fR: The number '3' resembles a backwards 'E'
.br
• \fBa → 4\fR: The number '4' contains the letter 'a' shape
.br
• \fBs → 5\fR: The number '5' resembles an 'S'
.br
• \fBi → 1\fR: The number '1' resembles lowercase 'i'
.br
• \fBt → 7\fR: The number '7' can resemble a 't' in certain fonts
.br
• \fBg → 9\fR: The number '9' bears some resemblance to 'g'
.br
.br
\fBIntelligent application:\fR
.br
• Respects domain length (longer domains allow more substitutions)
.br
• Maximum 40% character substitution to maintain readability
.br
• Realistic spacing prevents consecutive substitutions in short domains
.br
• Prioritizes high-impact substitutions (o→0, l→1) for maximum visual similarity
.br
.br
\fBReal-world examples:\fR
.br
google.com → g00gle.com, g0ogle.com, goog1e.com, 9oogle.com
.br
amazon.com → amaz0n.com, amazon.com → am4z0n.com, amazon.com → 4mazon.com
.br
paypal.com → paypa1.com, paypal.com → p4ypal.com, paypal.com → payp4l.com  
.br
microsoft.com → micr0soft.com, microsoft.com → micr050ft.com, microsoft.com → m1cr0soft.com

.TP
.B misspelling
Comprehensive typing error simulation that models the most common mistakes users make when entering domain names. This transformation consolidates multiple error types into a single, realistic algorithm that respects natural typing patterns and constraints. It simulates both accidental errors (typos, slips) and cognitive errors (transpositions, substitutions).
.br
.br
\fBError types implemented:\fR
.br
• \fBCharacter deletion\fR: Accidentally skip a letter while typing
.br
• \fBCharacter insertion\fR: Accidentally hit an extra key or double-type
.br
• \fBCharacter transposition\fR: Swap two adjacent characters (very common error)
.br
• \fBCharacter substitution\fR: Hit a wrong key, often adjacent to correct key
.br
• \fBVowel swapping\fR: Confuse similar vowel sounds (a/e, o/u, i/e)
.br
• \fBKeyboard adjacent errors\fR: Hit keys physically next to the intended key
.br
.br
\fBIntelligent error modeling:\fR
.br
• Frequency-based error placement (more errors in middle of words)
.br
• Length-aware constraints (shorter domains get fewer errors)
.br
• Realistic error combinations (1-3 errors per domain maximum)
.br
• Position weighting (avoids errors at start/end of short domains)
.br
• QWERTY keyboard layout modeling for adjacent key errors
.br
.br
\fBReal-world examples:\fR
.br
google.com → googlle.com (double-l insertion), gogle.com (o deletion)
.br
amazon.com → amazno.com (transposition), amozon.com (a→o vowel swap)
.br
paypal.com → paypla.com (transposition), oaypal.com (adjacent key p→o)
.br
facebook.com → facbook.com (e deletion), faceboook.com (o insertion)
.br
microsoft.com → microsfot.com (transposition), microsift.com (o→i substitution)

.TP
.B fat-finger
Models accidental keypresses that occur when users type too quickly or press keys imprecisely. This transformation simulates the "fat finger" effect where users accidentally hit multiple keys or keys adjacent to their target. The algorithm focuses specifically on key repetition and insertion errors that result from imprecise finger placement or timing.
.br
.br
\fBError mechanisms:\fR
.br
• \fBCharacter doubling\fR: Hold key too long or press twice accidentally
.br
• \fBAdjacent key insertion\fR: Press extra key next to intended target
.br
• \fBMultiple adjacent errors\fR: Several finger placement errors in same domain
.br
• \fBTyping speed errors\fR: Errors that occur during fast typing
.br
.br
\fBQWERTY adjacency modeling:\fR
.br
• Horizontal adjacency: q↔w↔e↔r↔t↔y, a↔s↔d↔f↔g↔h, z↔x↔c↔v↔b↔n
.br
• Vertical adjacency: q↔a↔z, w↔s↔x, e↔d↔c, r↔f↔v, t↔g↔b, etc.
.br
• Diagonal adjacency: q↔s, w↔a↔d, e↔s↔f, etc.
.br
• Common mistakes: o↔p, l↔;, n↔m, etc.
.br
.br
\fBRealistic constraints:\fR
.br
• Prevents excessive repetition (max 2-3 repeated characters)
.br
• Limits adjacent errors to maintain readability
.br
• Frequency-based placement (more errors in frequently-hit keys)
.br
• Length-appropriate error density
.br
.br
\fBReal-world examples:\fR
.br
google.com → gooogle.com (o repetition), googgle.com (g repetition)
.br
amazon.com → amazoon.com (o doubling), amaozn.com (adjacent z→o)
.br
paypal.com → paypall.com (l doubling), paypakl.com (adjacent l→k)
.br
facebook.com → facebookk.com (k doubling), favebook.com (adjacent c→v)
.br
microsoft.com → microosoft.com (o doubling), microsofft.com (f doubling)

.TP
.B bitsquatting
Advanced transformation that simulates single bit-flip errors in ASCII characters, modeling hardware failures, memory corruption, cosmic ray strikes, or transmission errors. This technique creates subtle domain variations that could occur naturally due to system faults, making them particularly insidious as they appear to be accidental rather than intentional attacks.
.br
.br
\fBBit-flip mechanism:\fR
.br
• Each ASCII character is represented as 8 bits (binary)
.br
• A single bit is flipped from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0
.br
• Results in a different but often visually similar character
.br
• Simulates real-world hardware error scenarios
.br
.br
\fBCommon bit-flip examples:\fR
.br
• \fB'o' (0x6F) → 'g' (0x67)\fR: Bit 3 flipped → google.com → ggogle.com
.br
• \fB'e' (0x65) → 'a' (0x61)\fR: Bit 2 flipped → secure.com → sacure.com
.br
• \fB'l' (0x6C) → 'h' (0x68)\fR: Bit 2 flipped → paypal.com → paypah.com
.br
• \fB'n' (0x6E) → 'f' (0x66)\fR: Bit 3 flipped → amazon.com → amazof.com
.br
• \fB'r' (0x72) → 's' (0x73)\fR: Bit 0 flipped → microsoft.com → microsoct.com
.br
.br
\fBAttack scenarios:\fR
.br
• Memory corruption during DNS resolution
.br
• Cosmic ray strikes on network equipment (rare but documented)
.br
• Hardware failures in routers or DNS servers
.br
• Electromagnetic interference affecting data transmission
.br
• Malicious manipulation disguised as system errors
.br
.br
\fBReal-world examples:\fR
.br
google.com → gmogle.com, foogle.com, woogle.com (various g bit-flips)
.br
amazon.com → amazoo.com, amajon.com, emaron.com (various bit-flips)
.br
paypal.com → qaypal.com, peypal.com, payqal.com (various bit-flips)

.SS Transformation Bundles
Logical groupings of related transformations:

.TP
.B lookalike
Character-level transformations that create visually similar domains. This is the default transformation bundle, specifically designed to generate domains that can fool users through visual deception. The lookalike bundle combines four core transformation types that attackers commonly use in phishing campaigns and typosquatting attacks.
.br
.br
The lookalike bundle includes:
.br
• \fB1337speak\fR - Leetspeak character substitutions (see 1337speak section)
.br
• \fBmisspelling\fR - Comprehensive typing error simulation (see misspelling section)  
.br
• \fBfat-finger\fR - Accidental keypress and repetition errors (see fat-finger section)
.br
• \fBmixed-encodings\fR - Unicode homograph attacks (see mixed-encodings section)
.br
.br
\fBWhy lookalike is the default:\fR This bundle represents the most dangerous and commonly used techniques in real-world attacks. These transformations are specifically chosen because they:
.br
• Create domains that look nearly identical to the original
.br
• Are difficult for users to spot, especially on mobile devices
.br
• Require no technical sophistication from attackers
.br
• Have high success rates in phishing campaigns
.br
• Cover both automated (typos, fat-finger) and intentional (1337speak, homographs) attack vectors
.br
.br
For detailed explanations and examples of each transformation, see the individual transformation sections below.



.SS COMBINATORIAL TRANSFORMATION MECHANICS
.B domfuzz
employs sophisticated algorithms to systematically generate domain variations through comprehensive position-based and combinatorial approaches. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for defensive security professionals implementing comprehensive domain monitoring strategies.

.TP
.B Position-Based Generation
Each transformation algorithm operates by identifying Ball possible positionsR within a domain where modifications can occur, then systematically applying changes at each valid location:

BExample: 1337speak on "google.com"R
.br
• Position analysis: g[0], o[1], o[2], g[3], l[4], e[5] 
.br
• Valid substitution positions: o[1]→0, o[2]→0, g[3]→9, l[4]→1, e[5]→3
.br
• Single-position results: g0ogle.com, go0gle.com, goo9le.com, goog1e.com, googl3.com
.br
• Multi-position combinations: g00gle.com, g0o9le.com, g009l3.com, etc.

.TP
.B Combinatorial Complexity
Transformations generate variations through multiple combinatorial approaches:

\fBSingle Transformations (Default Mode)\fR:
.br
• Each transformation applied independently to original domain
.br
• Systematic enumeration of all valid position combinations
.br
• Realistic constraints prevent combinatorial explosion
.br
• Example: "paypal" with 1337speak → 32 variations across all position combinations

\fBMulti-Position Combinations\fR:
.br
• Algorithms intelligently combine multiple modifications within single transformation
.br
• Length-aware constraints (short domains: 1-2 changes, long domains: up to 40% modification)
.br
• Distance-based spacing prevents adjacent modifications in short domains
.br
• Priority weighting favors high-impact substitutions (o→0, l→1 prioritized over rare substitutions)

\fBCombo Mode Chains\fR:
.br
• Sequential application of 2-5 different transformation types
.br
• Each transformation operates on result of previous transformation
.br
• Weighted selection prevents conflicting transformations
.br
• Example chain: google.com → 1337speak → gooogle.com → fat-finger → goo0gle.com → misspelling → goo0gle.net

.TP
.B Algorithmic Intelligence
Modern typosquatting attacks require sophisticated generation algorithms that balance comprehensiveness with realism:

\fBConstraint Systems\fR:
.br
• \fBLength constraints\fR: Shorter domains receive fewer modifications to maintain plausibility
.br
• \fBFrequency weighting\fR: Common errors (o→0, l→1) generated more often than rare ones
.br
• \fBPosition analysis\fR: Errors weighted by natural typing patterns (more errors in middle of words)
.br
• BReadability preservationR: Maximum modification percentages prevent unrecognizable results

BRealistic Error ModelingR:
.br
• BQWERTY adjacencyR: Keyboard-aware error generation based on physical key proximity
.br
• \fBPhonetic patterns\fR: Sound-based substitutions follow linguistic probability distributions
.br
• \fBTyping psychology\fR: Error placement reflects actual human typing behavior studies
.br
• \fBDevice-specific patterns\fR: Mobile vs desktop typing error signatures

.TP
.B Permutation Mathematics  
The mathematical foundation ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining computational efficiency:

\fBPosition Permutations\fR:
.br
For domain of length n with k transformable positions:
.br
• Single position: k variations
.br
• Two positions: C(k,2) = k!/(2!(k-2)!) combinations  
.br
• Multiple positions: Σ C(k,i) for i=1 to max_errors

\fBExample: "amazon" (6 characters) with 1337speak\fR:
.br
• Transformable positions: a[0]→4, a[2]→4, o[3]→0, n[5]→n (4 positions)
.br
• Single position: 4 variations  
.br
• Two positions: C(4,2) = 6 combinations
.br
• Three positions: C(4,3) = 4 combinations
.br
• Total theoretical: 14 combinations (filtered by realistic constraints)

\fBConstraint Filtering\fR:
.br
• Theoretical combinations filtered through multiple constraint layers
.br
• Similarity thresholds eliminate excessive modifications
.br
• Readability filters ensure recognizable results
.br
• Domain validation removes invalid DNS names
.br
• Deduplication eliminates identical results from different algorithms

.SH MODES OF OPERATION

.SS Combo Mode (Default)
In combo mode, multiple transformations are applied sequentially to create complex variations. Each generated domain goes through 2-5 random transformations from the enabled set, creating sophisticated combinations that simulate real-world attack scenarios.

.SS One-Transformation Mode (-1)
In one-transformation mode, each enabled transformation is applied individually to the original domain. This mode is useful for understanding the specific impact of each transformation type and for systematic analysis.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The output format varies depending on options:

.TP
.B Basic Output
Each line contains a domain variation.

.TP
.B With Similarity Scoring
Format: \fISIMILARITY_SCORE\fR, \fIDOMAIN\fR

.TP
.B With Status Checking
Format: \fISIMILARITY_SCORE\fR, \fIDOMAIN\fR, \fISTATUS\fR
.br
Where STATUS is one of: available, registered, parked, error

.SH SIMILARITY SCORING
When similarity scoring is enabled, domfuzz calculates three types of similarity:

.TP
.B Visual Similarity
Measures how visually similar the variation appears to the original domain using character shape and appearance analysis.

.TP
.B Cognitive Similarity
Measures how mentally similar the variation is using phonetic analysis and semantic meaning.

.TP
.B Combined Score
A weighted combination of visual and cognitive similarity scores, providing an overall assessment of how deceptive the variation might be.
